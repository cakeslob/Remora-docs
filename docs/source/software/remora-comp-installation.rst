The Remora component is the SPI interface between LinuxCNC and the LPC17xx/STM32F4 controller board as well as being the LinuxCNC side of the step pulse generators. Further details can be found in the Development Guide.

To install the Remora component:

1. Open a terminal window on the rPi, download the Remora repository and change to the Remora component directory

    pi@raspberry:~ $ cd ~/linuxcnc
    pi@raspberry:~ $ git clone https://github.com/scottalford75/Remora
    pi@raspberry:~ $ cd Remora/LinuxCNC/Components/Remora
    	
2. You should see the source files into the directory with the 'ls' command

.. code-block::

    bcm2835.c
    bcm2835.h
    remora.c
    remora.h
