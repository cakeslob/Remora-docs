Firmware and Config
-------------------

This firmware is specific to the Nucleo64 F446RE in combination with the classic grbl cnc shield. 

The config for the Nucleo/CNC shield is a static configuration based around the pinout of the grbl shield.
It is a static configuration, so to change any pinout, it would be required to compile firmware with adjustments. That will not be covered in the scope of this documentation at this time.  


Wiring
------

Wiring requires the following components:

* 100mm Female-Female Dupont ribbon jumper
* 6 way (1x6) Dupont connector
