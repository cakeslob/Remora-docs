.. note::

Firmware
---------
Loading the firmware is for this is hard. this is place holder for that, and the several steps involved



Config
------

something about loading the config, maybe link to ethernet config page
something about ec300/ec500/NVEM ? 


Hardware Pins
-------------
Remora firmware has some features available only on specific hardware pins.

Available PWM Hardware pins:

- not changeable???

Available QEsomething Encoder Hardware pins:

- PE_9
- PE_11
- PE_13 is used as index

DMA Stepgen
-----------

Wiring
------

hmm placeholder. not sure what to put here

NVMPG
------
	
UART wiring info
----------------

needs rs232 adapter?
