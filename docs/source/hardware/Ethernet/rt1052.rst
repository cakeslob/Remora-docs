Firmware
---------
Loading the firmware is for this is hard. this is place holder for that, and the several steps involved

- Note : The MbedOS5 version of the 446 firmware overwrites the bootloader. A working version could not be realised at the time of writing, so firmware updates afterwards need to be done with STLINK or the DFU boot via USB-c. The original bootloader is avaiable on the BTT github page. 

- Note : The MbedOS6 version of the 446 firmware has bootloader support. 


- Firmware for the STM32F429 version is STM32F429/BTT_429
- Firmware for the STM32F446 version is STM32F446/BTT_446
- Firmware for other versions are unavailable or untested
