Fysetc Spider
====================

Wiring for the Spider board is very straight forward with all pins directly available on the EXP2 header.
	

Firmware and Config
-------------------
The Spider uses an STM32F446. 

- Note: The Fysetc Spider firmware source is found in the MbedOS6 branch, as a working version for MbedOS5 could not be realised at the time of writing this. 

- Firmware for the Fysetc Spider is located under STM32F446/SPIDER


In your .hal file, you will need to configure the Remora chip_type to "STM"

.. code-block::

		loadrt remora chip_type=STM



Hardware Pins
-------------
Remora firmware has some features available only on specific hardware pins. These pins can vary between STM32 boards.

Available PWM Hardware pins:

-  PA_1 PA_2 PA_3 PA_5 PA_6 PA_7 PA_8  PA_9 PA_10 PA_11 PA_15
- PB_0 PB_1 PB_3 PB_4 PB_5 PB_6 PB_7 PB_8 PB_9 PB_10 PB_11 PB_13 PB_14 PB_15
- PC_6 PC_7 PC_8 PC_9
- PE_5 PE_6 PE_8 PE_9 PE_10 PE_11

Available QEI Encoder Hardware pins:

- PE_9
- PE_11
- PE_13 is used as index

Wiring
------

Wiring requires the following components:

* 100mm Female-Female Dupont ribbon jumper
* 10 way (2x5) Dupont connector
* 8 way (2x4) Dupont connector

The pinout for the Fysetc Spider is slightly different than other versions. Please read the pinout carefully.

SPIDER V2.2
	
To UART from the Raspberry Pi to the Spider the follwoing components are requried:

* 150mm or 200mm Female-Female Dupont ribbon jumper
* 5 way (1x5) Dupont connector
* 5 way (1x5) Dupont connector

The diagram above includes the optional serial debug interface. Note that TX <-> RXD and RX <-> TXD. The standard order for serial is different with the Fysetc Spider 2.2 , so please pay close attention to the wiring. 

- Note: The Spider had some issues on some versions with silkscreen and PWR/GND wiring. As the PWR/GND are not needs, it is recomended to not connect those unless you are sure of the pinout.
